# Overview

The city of Rexburg, Idaho has a shuttle service run by Walmart and Salt Lake Express, which circles the college campus and crosses a large part of the city. While the intention of this service is to make it easier for students to access Walmart, it also provides more access to the rest of the city to those who don't have a car of their own. The purpose of this website is to identify each restaurant in Rexburg within 1-2 blocks of a Walmart shuttle stop, as well as their busiest times.
